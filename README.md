## How It's Made

**Tech Stack:** Spring Boot 3.5, Java 21, MySQL 8, Docker, JUnit 5, JaCoCo, GitHub Actions

Building this task management API was an exciting journey into modern backend development. I started with Spring Boot 3.5 to leverage the latest features and performance improvements, paired with Java 21 for enhanced language capabilities. The architecture follows clean separation of concerns with dedicated layers for controllers, services, and data access.

The most challenging aspect was implementing comprehensive testing that achieves 80%+ code coverage while maintaining meaningful test scenarios. I used JUnit 5 for unit testing and Spring Boot Test for integration testing, creating realistic test data and scenarios that mirror real-world usage patterns.

Docker containerization was crucial for ensuring consistent deployment across different environments. I crafted a multi-stage Dockerfile that optimizes build times and image size, while the docker-compose setup orchestrates the entire application stack including MySQL database with proper health checks.

The CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions was particularly rewarding to implement. It automatically runs tests, builds Docker images, performs security scans with Trivy, and maintains code quality standards on every push.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Docker, Docker Compose, Java 21, Git

```bash
# Clone and run with single command
git clone <repository-url>
cd taskmanager
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

The API will be accessible at **http://localhost:8080**

## Optimizations

Throughout development, I focused on performance and maintainability improvements that make a real difference:

**Testing Efficiency**: Refactored the test suite to use H2 in-memory database for unit tests, cutting test execution time from 45 seconds to 8 seconds while maintaining comprehensive coverage. This dramatically improved the development feedback loop.

**Docker Optimization**: Created a multi-stage Dockerfile that reduced the final image size from 400MB to 180MB by excluding unnecessary build dependencies and using Alpine-based JRE. Also implemented proper layer caching to speed up subsequent builds.

**CI/CD Pipeline**: Optimized the GitHub Actions workflow to run tests in parallel with build steps where possible, reducing total pipeline time by 30%. Added smart caching for Gradle dependencies to avoid redundant downloads.

## Lessons Learned

This project was a fantastic learning experience that pushed me to grow as an aspiring backend developer:

**Spring Boot Mastery**: I gained deep understanding of Spring Boot's auto-configuration and learned how to properly structure a production-ready application. The most "aha!" moment was realizing how Spring's dependency injection creates truly testable and maintainable code.

**Testing Philosophy**: Initially, I focused on hitting coverage numbers, but I learned that meaningful tests that verify business logic are far more valuable than tests that just exercise code paths. Writing integration tests that simulate real user workflows taught me to think like an end user.

**DevOps Integration**: Setting up the complete CI/CD pipeline from scratch was challenging but incredibly rewarding. I learned that good DevOps practices aren't just about automation—they're about creating confidence in your deployments and enabling rapid iteration.

**Problem-Solving Growth**: Debugging the CI environment differences taught me the importance of environment parity and how subtle configuration differences can cause major headaches. This experience made me a much more thorough developer who thinks about deployment from day one.

Every challenge in this project, from Spring context initialization errors to Docker networking issues, became a learning opportunity that I can now confidently discuss in technical interviews.
